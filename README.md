# Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to take a raw, "dirty" dataset and transform it into a clean, usable format. The process involves identifying and handling common data quality issues such as missing values and duplicates. Once the data is cleaned, I use Matplotlib to create a series of visualizations that provide a clear and concise overview of the dataset's key characteristics. This project serves as a practical example of a fundamental data analysis workflow.

# Key Features
1. Comprehensive Data Cleaning:
   - Duplicate Removal: Efficiently identifies and removes duplicate records.
   - Strategic Missing Value Imputation:
      Fills categorical missing data (Name, Country) with "Unknown".
   - Assigns placeholder values for missing contact information (Email, PhoneNumber).
   - Imputes missing numerical data (Age, Salary) with the column's mean to maintain statistical integrity.
   - Standardizes missing JoiningDate with a default value.
   - Data Type Standardization: 
      Converts JoiningDate to a proper datetime format for time-series analysis.
2. Insightful Data Visualization:
   - Country Distribution: A bar chart to visualize the geographical distribution of employees.
   - Age Demographics: 
   A histogram to understand the age spread of the workforce.
   - Salary Analysis: 
      A histogram to illustrate the salary distribution across the company.
3. Data Export:
   - Saves the clean, analysis-ready dataset to a new CSV file, clean_data.csv.

# Getting Started
To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these simple steps.

##  Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python 3.6 or later installed. You will also need pip to install the required libraries.

##  Installation
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-cleaning-and-visualization.git
cd data-cleaning-and-visualization
```


Install the required libraries:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

(Note: You will need to create a requirements.txt file containing pandas and matplotlib)

### How to Run
Place your data: Ensure your raw data file, dirty_data_for_cleaning.csv, is in the root of the project directory.
Execute the script:
```bash
python data_cleaning.py
```

Check the output:
The script will generate and display three plots.
The cleaned data will be saved as clean_data.csv.
Visualizations
The script will automatically generate the following plots to help you understand the cleaned data:

Employee Count by Country: Highlights the geographical diversity of the workforce.
Age Distribution of Employees: Shows the age demographics.
Salary Distribution of Employees: Provides insights into the salary structure.
(You can include images of your plots here for a more visual README)

# Future Enhancements
I have several ideas for extending this project's capabilities:

Advanced Visualizations: Incorporate a correlation heatmap to explore relationships between numerical variables and use pie charts for a different view of categorical data.
Modular Cleaning Pipeline: Refactor the code into a more structured, object-oriented pipeline that can be easily reused for other datasets.
Interactive Dashboard: Develop an interactive dashboard using Plotly or Dash to allow for dynamic exploration of the data.
Automated Reporting: Generate an automated PDF report summarizing the cleaning process and key findings from the visualizations.
