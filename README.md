# Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to take a raw, "dirty" dataset and transform it into a clean, usable format. The process involves identifying and handling common data quality issues such as missing values and duplicates. Once the data is cleaned, I use Matplotlib to create a series of visualizations that provide a clear and concise overview of the dataset's key characteristics. This project serves as a practical example of a fundamental data analysis workflow.

# Key Features
Comprehensive Data Cleaning:
Duplicate Removal: Efficiently identifies and removes duplicate records.
Strategic Missing Value Imputation:
Fills categorical missing data (Name, Country) with "Unknown".
Assigns placeholder values for missing contact information (Email, PhoneNumber).
Imputes missing numerical data (Age, Salary) with the column's mean to maintain statistical integrity.
Standardizes missing JoiningDate with a default value.
Data Type Standardization: Converts JoiningDate to a proper datetime format for time-series analysis.
Insightful Data Visualization:
Country Distribution: A bar chart to visualize the geographical distribution of employees.
Age Demographics: A histogram to understand the age spread of the workforce.
Salary Analysis: A histogram to illustrate the salary distribution across the company.
Data Export:
Saves the clean, analysis-ready dataset to a new CSV file, clean_data.csv.

Getting Started
To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these simple steps.

# Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python 3.6 or later installed. You will also need pip to install the required libraries.

# Installation
Clone the repository:
Generated bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-cleaning-and-visualization.git
cd data-cleaning-and-visualization
Use code with caution.
Bash
Install the required libraries:
Generated bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Use code with caution.
Bash
(Note: You will need to create a requirements.txt file containing pandas and matplotlib)
How to Run
Place your data: Ensure your raw data file, dirty_data_for_cleaning.csv, is in the root of the project directory.
Execute the script:
Generated bash
python data_cleaning.py
Use code with caution.
Bash
Check the output:
The script will generate and display three plots.
The cleaned data will be saved as clean_data.csv.
Visualizations
The script will automatically generate the following plots to help you understand the cleaned data:

Employee Count by Country: Highlights the geographical diversity of the workforce.
Age Distribution of Employees: Shows the age demographics.
Salary Distribution of Employees: Provides insights into the salary structure.
(You can include images of your plots here for a more visual README)

# Future Enhancements
I have several ideas for extending this project's capabilities:

Advanced Visualizations: Incorporate a correlation heatmap to explore relationships between numerical variables and use pie charts for a different view of categorical data.
Modular Cleaning Pipeline: Refactor the code into a more structured, object-oriented pipeline that can be easily reused for other datasets.
Interactive Dashboard: Develop an interactive dashboard using Plotly or Dash to allow for dynamic exploration of the data.
Automated Reporting: Generate an automated PDF report summarizing the cleaning process and key findings from the visualizations.
